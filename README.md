# Capitalizor

This app will take a string and capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence. The main focus of this project is to practice the logic behind the app using javascript.

## MVP

To consider this project complete, I need to accomplish the following:

- Must have an input field to take user input
- A button to perform the function
- Basic CSS styling to make it presentable
- Fully functional logic
